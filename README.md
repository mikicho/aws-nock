# AWS Nock

Fast AWS testing with nock

## Why

- You test everything you run in production.
- Spy only, no mocking. Which helps you write well-bounded [integration tests](https://github.com/testjavascript/nodejs-integration-tests-best-practices).
- A faster and in-process [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) alternative for Node.js.
